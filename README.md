# team-project-questionnaire-app

Team project of Introduction to JavaScript and Modern Web Development

Vojislav (@Gruximillian) and Jing (@Jing-Ran) worked together to create the first questionnaire card. They utilized the live collaboration feature of jsfiddle.com to communicate, build the structure of the HTML document and style the CSS file. Most of the CSS rules were created during the collaboration. After the collaboration, majority part of the project had been decided and built. Then, they split the rest four cards.

Vojislav took in charge of the second and fourth cards. 

Jing took in charge of the third and the last cards. 

They added rulesets for the un-styled classes which appeared in their own cards respectively. Also, they finalized the project by restyling some minor points.
