      <h2 class="section-title">Brief description</h2>

      <p>The HTML &lt;i&gt; (paragraph) element is used to represent parts of the text that is in some way different from other text. That can be a technical term, a phrase from a foreign language, a thought or names of objects.</p>

      <p>The &lt;i&gt; element should represent the part of the text that has different semantic meaning from the rest of the text and the text enclosed in &lt;i&gt; element may be displayed in italics by the browser.</p>

      <p>The &lt;i&gt; element should only be used when there is not more appropriate semantic element. Some elements that should be considered before using &lt;i&gt; element are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>&lt;em&gt; - emphasized text</li>
        <li>&lt;strong&gt; - important text</li>
        <li>&lt;mark&gt; - marked/highlighted text</li>
        <li>&lt;cite&gt; - the title of a work</li>
        <li>&lt;dfn&gt; - a definition term</li>
      </ul>
